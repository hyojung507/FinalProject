# Final Proposal
I want to build a portfolio page that clearly addresses my personality and my point of view of graphic design that goes along with the series of work. (examples: http://iannam.com/, http://www.studiolin.org/projects) Along my portfolio, I also want to create some small projects based on interactive movements of the web. I want these to have user experience and interaction. The useless web (paper.js) can be an option; and also I yearn for the interaction of images and typography in web as well.
